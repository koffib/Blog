                <h3> Game Design History</h3>
                <p>
                    Video games are nearly as old as mass-produced computers themselves, with early games appearing in laboratories in the 1950s.<br> Some of the first games included a version of tic-tac-toe and a digital tennis match.
                     In the late 1970s, video game design evolved. With arcade games like Space Invaders leading the way, groundwork for video game design involved leveled progression through increasingly challenging obstacles.<br> The addition of an axis of abilities, where characters gain temporary skills, added a new level of complexity to the design process.
                     Today, players expect high graphic performance and interactive story experiences.<br> Gamers play on desktop computers, external consoles, and mobile applications, allowing video game designers to specialize their skills for specific platforms.
