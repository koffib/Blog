                 <h3>Web Design Definition</h3>
                 <p>
                  The data scientist is an expert in the collection, storage, analysis and exploitation of a set of data collected via different channels, generally on behalf of a company. In view of the enormous volumes of information that data scientists have to process, we talk about big data. To do this, the data scientist crosses data and develops new statistical models in order to analyze the company's performance and anticipate consumer behavior or new trends.

              <h3>UCD: User-Centered Design</h3>
              <p>
                UCD is the concept of web design that takes into consideration and understands the needs of users. The user is therefore involved in all aspects of the design and its evaluation. In order to create a UCD design, web designers proceed in four distinct phases:
                <ul>
                  <li>Understanding the context in which the system is used</li>
                  <li>Specifying user requirements</li>
                  <li>Creating an initial design</li>
                  <li>Evaluation of the design by the users</li>
                </ul> 
              </p>

              <h3> The UX Design Concept</h3>
             <p>
              UX design, on the other hand, seeks to improve the user experience by focusing on usability, accessibility and the user's satisfaction in interacting with the product or service. In simple terms, UX design is what brings the company and the user together.
