                   <h3>Software Developer</h3>
                   <p>
                    A software developer plays a key role in identifying, designing, installing and testing a software system that has been built for a company from the ground up. They create these to ensure that the processes are running as expected. The skills needed for a software developer are coding languages such as JavaScript, C++, Ruby, C# and .Net to name a few. These types of developers should also be comfortable writing and analysing queries and working with different frameworks.

                <h3> JavaScript </h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has been the final choice of developers and has been used to develop thousands of projects since its first release in 1995. The language is suitable for web development, backend development, serverless computing, mobile development and game development. It is a very flexible language, very fast on the client side, with excellent community support, easy on servers and integrates well with other programming languages.

                Ruby is a scripting language used primarily for web development. It was the basis of the Ruby on Rails web application framework. Beginning developers gravitate towards Ruby because it is a user-friendly language with an excellent and active user community. Twitter, Bloomberg, Airbnb, Shopify and other startups have successfully used Ruby on Rails.
