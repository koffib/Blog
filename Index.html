      <h2> Technology-enhanced players and training </h2>
      The use of technology in football and other sports is becoming an increasingly common, as well as necessary, occurrence and revolutionises the way in which football training is approached. 
      Heart rate monitors and GPS trackers on vests, advanced monitoring and camera systems, apps to track official games, and training sessions with drones – all this, and various kinds of other technologies, provide a wealth of information, such as a player’s muscle fatigue or the evolution of his performance throughout a football season. 
      Once collected and analysed, all of this information leads to improved performance. GMR (‘gamer’) from Google, Adidas, and EA, for instance, is a smart shoe insole and app system that automatically measures data on running distance, dribbling, passing, and different types of kicks, such as normal and penalty kicking. 
      The German men’s national football team is kitted out with smart Adidas jerseys that track distance, speed, and pulse to help optimise training schedules and develop game strategies. 
      Coaches can also use this information to pick up irregularities or patterns indicating a change in player performance, which could indicate an upcoming injury.
